Hi there, 

Please follow the steps below to run the code. 

I have the backend folder written inside the main folder where there is frontend as well. I had not seperated the two as I already started and was running short on time.

Navigate to the backend folder and run the command npm run dev, this should start the backend server on port 8000. 

Navigate to the root folder and then run npm start or npm run start, this should run the react project on localhost 3000.
